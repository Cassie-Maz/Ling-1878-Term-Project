# Ling-1878-Term-Project
This repository contains a pdf file that combines all the field 
reports 
I created for Ling 1878, a graduate level phonetics and phonemics 
course at the University of Pittsburgh. I learned core concepts by 
interviewing a Polish speaker and identifying contrasting sounds in 
their language.
